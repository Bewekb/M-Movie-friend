# M-Movie-friend
This is my Final project for the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp, in which we presented what we learn through the entire course and what we are actually capable of after it.
I decided to create a movie recommendation app based on the emotion of human. For instance, If i am not feeling good or happy, it will recoomend you to watch some sort of movies,which wil change your mood.
To execute this idea i use python, Java script ,Html and css through flask.
